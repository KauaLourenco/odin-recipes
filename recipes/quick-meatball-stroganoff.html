        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is
                almost soft, about 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce heat to medium; stir in condensed soup, milk, and Worcestershire sauce. Add meatballs; reduce
                heat to low and simmer, covered, until tender, 35 to 40 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook, stirring
                occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes; drain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add sour cream, salt, and pepper to meatballs in sauce. Cook until flavors combine, about 2 minutes.
                Serve meatballs over noodles.
            </li>
